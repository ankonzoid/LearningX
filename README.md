# Deep Reinforcement Learning Tutorials

We provide here a set of beginner hands-on Python examples in both Classical & Deep Reinforcement Learning. Each example is self-contained with all code stored in one `.py` file, and usage of it involves only running the file in its local directory. Each example has its own README.md file briefly discussing the theory and usage. 


 ## Classical Reinforcement Learning
 
* [Solving the Multi-Armed Bandit Problem](https://github.com/ankonzoid/Reinforcement-Learning-Tutorials/tree/master/multiarmed_bandit) (`multiarmed_bandit.py`)

* [Training an Agent to beat GridWorld](https://github.com/ankonzoid/Reinforcement-Learning-Tutorials/tree/master/gridworld) (`gridworld.py`) 

* [# Training a Hunter Agent to capture Prey on 2D grid using relative coordinates](https://github.com/ankonzoid/Reinforcement-Learning-Tutorials/tree/master/hunterprey) (`hunterprey.py`) 

 ## Deep Reinforcement Learning
 
* [Q-learning on OpenGym environments](https://github.com/ankonzoid/Reinforcement-Learning-Tutorials/tree/master/gym) (`gym.py`)
